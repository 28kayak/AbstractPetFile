/*In a separate file, write a driver class (includes main). In main, declare an array of Pet objects, then do call the following static methods:
- a method (in the same class as main that you write) that returns (in a return statement) an array of Pet objects. In this method, read the size of array from the user, (don't allow < 1 or > 50)* allocate memory for the array, the assign to each element the return value from a static method that reads and PARSES the input (in another method, see A. below).
- a method (in the same class as main that you write) to sort the array by name (be sure to use the length variable of the array), using the String class' compareToIgnoreCase method.
- a method (in the same class as main that you write) that prints each object's toString AND the return value from convertYears AND return value from speak in an enhanced for loop. THERE ARE NO IF STATEMENTS NOR CONDITION/TERNARY OPERATORS IN THIS METHOD!
- a method (in the same class as main that you write) to return how many Cats in the array (if any) are indoor Cats (described in B. below)
- If the return value is >= 0, print the how many cats are indoor cats, or if it is -1, print "No cats".
